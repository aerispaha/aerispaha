# How we built a camper van solar system to power all our things


In the earliest weeks of 2020, my wife and I (along with our cat) decided to
leave our beloved studio apartment in Philadelphia for a life on the road. We
found a humble, but very well-preserved, 1985 Dodge Roadtrek campervan. 


#### Overview
- design process/decisions
  - design criteria:
    - energy demand (peak load, daily consumption)
    - battery supply for a 2 days
    - recharge duration
  - battery selection
    - huge decision that impacted a lot of other components
    - connecting in series, 24V inverter
  - panel selection  
- installation process
  - hacking the tesla module, finding the balance leads
  - panel installation: no new holes drilled in roof. VHB tape
  - splicing into 12V system: massive frustration with not understanding how
    cars use the chassis as a negative wire.
  - drilling into the water main
- Performance after installation
  - running AC in heat emergencies for cat
  - 40 amp breaker not sufficient, special order of 60 amp DC breaker shipped to
